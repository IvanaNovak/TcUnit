    (* TcUnit logs complete test results. These include:
         - Amount of test suites
         - Amount of tests
         - Amount of successful tests
         - Amount of failed tests
         - Any eventual failed assertion (with the expected & actual value plus an user defined message)
       These are all printed to the ADS logger (Visual Studio error list) marked with ERROR criticality

       On top of this TcUnit also reports some statistics/extended information with HINT/INFO criticality.
       These statistics are more detailed results of the tests. This information is used when results are
       being collected by an external software (such as TcUnit-Runner) to do for example Jenkins integration.
       This extra information however takes time to print, so by setting the following parameter to FALSE
       it will speed up TcUnit finishing. *)

    (* This is the maximum number of ADS-messages that can be stored for reporting at the same time.
       Having a size of 2000 means that it's possible to report up to ~400 test cases in one single
       PLC cycle. Each entry consumes around 500 bytes, so with an example of a ring buffer size of
       2000 it means that TcUnit will consume around 1 MB of router memory. *)
